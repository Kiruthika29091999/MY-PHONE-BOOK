<h1>PHONE BOOK</h1>
<p>A mobile phone, cellular phone, cell phone, cellphone, handphone, 
or hand phone, sometimes shortened to simply mobile, cell or just phone, 
is a portable telephone that can make and receive calls over a radio frequency link while 
the user is moving within a telephone service area</p>
<p>Smartphone
Main article: Smartphone
Smartphones have a number of distinguishing features. The International Telecommunication Union measures those with Internet connection, which it calls Active Mobile-Broadband subscriptions (which includes tablets, etc.). In the developed world, smartphones have now overtaken the usage of earlier mobile systems. 
However, in the developing world, they account for around 50% of mobile telephony.</p>

<h2>HISTORY</h2>
<p>A handheld mobile radio telephone service was envisioned in the early stages of radio engineering. In 1917, Finnish inventor Eric Tigerstedt filed a patent for a "pocket-size folding telephone with a very thin carbon microphone". Early predecessors of cellular phones included analog radio communications from ships and trains. The race to create truly portable telephone devices began after World War II, with developments taking place in many countries. The advances in mobile telephony have been traced in successive "generations", starting with the early zeroth-generation (0G) services,
 such as Bell System's Mobile Telephone Service and its successor.The development of metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) large-scale integration (LSI) technology, information theory and cellular networking led to the development of affordable mobile communications,[1] and devices such as the car phone. The first handheld cellular mobile phone was demonstrated by John F. Mitchell[2][3] and Martin Cooper of Motorola in 1973, using a handset weighing 2 kilograms (4.4 lb).[4] 
 The first commercial automated cellular network (1G) analog was launched in Japan by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone in 1979.</p>

 A contact list is a collection of screen names. It is a commonplace feature of instant messaging, Email clients, online games and mobile phones. It has various trademarked and proprietary names in different contexts.
The contact list is just a list. Its window shows screennames that represent actual other people.
To communicate with someone on the list, the user can select a name and act upon it, for example open a new E-mail editing session, instant message, or telephone call. In some programs, if your contact list shows someone, their list will show yours. 
Contact lists for mobile operating systems are often shared among several mobile apps.
Some text message clients allow you to change your display name at will while others only allow you to reformat your screen name (Add/remove spaces and capitalize letters). 
Generally, it makes no difference other than how it's displayed</p>
